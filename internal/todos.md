Once a section is written, use the add-crash-course-links.md file to add links to the crash course.

Also enrich the Add Crash Course Links prompt and the LESSON_LEARNINGS.md prompt with an actual URL map of the crash course stuff on the site.

Debate doing the sub-agent stuff, which is rock solid, or do a section on really good UX.

My reasoning here is that sub-agents are not always useful and what might be useful sooner is The ability to do OpenAI's style tool groupings, where you have groups of tools that allow you to talk to apps and that makes those tools active for that session. You can tell AI to use its search tool for instance.

Essentially this would be copying the patterns shown in Claude Code too, where you can queue up messages for your personal assistant to do afterwards.

Another possibility here is to dive into long-running workflows where we can have a queuing system.

Or just the ability to abort the personal assistant as it's going.

I do think probably the sum of all of that will end up being less exciting than just saying, we're doing sub-agents.
