For problem/solution lessons, the speaker notes should be in the following format:

# Lesson Title

## Problem

### Intro

A bulleted list of things the speaker should say. Focus on _why_ we're learning this, and what problems it will solve for them in the real world.

### Steps To Complete

Provide a list of phases for the user to complete the lesson.

#### Phase 1

Create a bullet-pointed list of things the speaker should say. Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

Provide markdown links to the relevant files in the lesson codebase.

## Solution

### Steps To Complete

Here, we'll show the complete solution, but still break it into phases for clarity. The phases here don't need to be the same as the phases in the problem.

#### Phase 1

Provide markdown links to the relevant files in the lesson codebase.
