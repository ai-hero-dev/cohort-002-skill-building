Create a lesson proposal.

<goals>
@workshop-goals.md contains the goals for the workshop and each lesson within it. This will help you scope the lesson proposal.

The idea of the course is to teach you how to build an AI personal assistant using the AI SDK.

There are two repositories - this one, and ../ai-personal-assistant.

Some sections of the course are skill building sections, and some are project work sections.

The skill building sections are exercises that are designed to teach you a specific skill. They are taught in this repo.

The project work sections are exercises that are designed to apply the skills you've learned in the skill building sections. The instructions for the project work are here, but the codebase is in the ../ai-personal-assistant repository.

<rules>
- Make it extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
</rules>

<lesson-proposal-format>
The lesson proposal should be in the following format:

# Lesson Title

## Learning Goals

A small paragraph of text that describes the learning goals of the lesson.

## Steps To Complete

A list of steps to complete the lesson. This should include the code that you need to write, and the output that you should see.

Include brief snippets of code for the implementation.

Include notes for things to be mindful of when completing the lesson.

This should be detailed, but still concise.

<task>
1. Create a lesson proposal inside the folder of the section you're working on, under `notes.md`.
2. Once the lesson proposal is done, update @workshop-goals.md with the new information.
